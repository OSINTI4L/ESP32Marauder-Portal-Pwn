Here you will find walk-throughs for various methods to crash, deauth, MITM, and spam ESP32Marauder evil portals utilizing [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/). For this guide, we will be targeting evil portals spun-up on the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/).

When attacking devices other than the Flipper Zero with the Hydra crash method you will need to change the IP address you are attacking as other devices do not consistantly spin-up webservers on 172.0.0.1 like the Flipper Zero does.
